//Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes/description/

//Code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int>res;
        vector<int>v(n);
        for(auto &x:edges)  v[x[1]]++;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(!v[i])   res.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

//TC: O(E+N)

//Approach: Simply find all the reachable nodes, the remaining ones will be the rquired nodes
//needed to reach all of them. For example, this was the vector made for given examples:
//v[_,1,2,_,1,1] and v[_,3,_,_,2]
